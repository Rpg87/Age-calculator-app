<p align="justify">
I was about to give up, if I accessed from a computer, it worked, from an android phone it worked, but when I accessed from an Iphone, it did not work. 
After researching, sleepless nights and being left without friends for monothematic, I understood that not all devices have the same date format. 
And that's how Slipt came into my life.
