I was about to give up, it worked from a computer, from an android phone too, but when I tried it from an Iphone, it didn't work. 
After researching, sleepless nights and being left without friends for monothematic, I understood that not all devices have the same date format. 
And that's how the division came into my life.

It is made with HTML, Css and Javascript so you don't need anything special. You can access directly by clicking on the [link](https://rpg87.github.io/Age-calculator-app/), you can fork the project or you can download the entire game. It is up to you.
